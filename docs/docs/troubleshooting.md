## Frequently Asked Questions

Please check the [list of frequently asked questions](faq.md).

## Black Screen / Failed Load / Dirty Disc

* Check your disc backup and verify that your backup is correct.
* Some games are susceptible to cache problems. Try clearing your cache, or
  simply try with a blank HDD image.

## Enabling Surround Sound in your EEPROM

* Surround Sound isn't supported in xemu yet, you should disable this in your [EEPROM](eeprom.md) if you have enabled it.

## Flatpak release will not load the Hard Drive

As explained in the [readme](https://github.com/flathub/app.xemu.Xemu?tab=readme-ov-file#usage): Only `$HOME/.var/app/app.xemu.xemu/data/xemu/xemu` can be written by xemu. The Hard Disk image has to be placed there, for example, at `$HOME/.var/app/app.xemu.xemu/data/xemu/xemu/xbox_hdd.qcow2`. To enable write permissions for the xbox_hdd.qcow2 hard drive file located outside xemu's flatpak system directory, you must grant xemu access to write in an alternative directory. This can be accomplished using either flatpak or flatseal.

Note: This step is not necessary for other system files, such as the BIOS or the MCPX ROM.

### Flatpak
1. `flatpak override app.xemu.xemu --user --filesystem="$HOME/savedgames/xemu/`

### Flatseal
1. Install [Flatseal](https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.github.tchx84.Flatseal)
2. Select <kbd>app.xemu.xemu</kbd>
3. In the <kbd>Filesystem</kbd> section, allow access to the folders your BIOS / MCPX / Hard Drive Image are in

## Windows Compatibility Issues

### Windows 11

**Crash on startup after configuration:** On Windows 11 Insider 23H2, there is an issue with Control Flow Guard being mistakenly enabled. See issue description and workaround [filed here](https://github.com/xemu-project/xemu/issues/1486#issuecomment-1647132796).

### Windows 7

!!! warning "Windows 7 is not officially supported"

    Windows 7 is no longer officially supported. xemu is not officially supported on Windows 7.

That said, xemu has been run on Windows 7 in the past. If you simply must run xemu on Windows 7, here are some tips that may help you:

**api-ms-win-core-path-l1-1-0.dll:** If you get a message for this missing DLL, see the workaround [filed here](https://github.com/xemu-project/xemu/issues/1482).

## Windows Performance Considerations

### Powersave vs Performance Power Management Profile

Ensure your computer is using a Performance power management profile. If you are using a laptop, connect your AC adapter to prevent throttling.

### Background Processes

Ensure any background processes are not consuming your system resources by checking the system task manager.

### Integrated vs Discrete GPU

In some systems you may have both integrated and discrete GPUs. By default, xemu
will request the high-performance discrete GPU. However, system configuration
and your graphics driver ultimately decide which GPU xemu is initialized with.

In Windows, you can specify which GPU should be used for a particular
application by navigating to <kbd>Display settings</kbd>&rarr;<kbd>Graphics settings</kbd>.

You can confirm which GPU xemu is actually using by looking at the "xemu.log"
file.

### Nvidia Settings

It is recommended to **disable** "Multi-threaded Optimizations" in the Nvidia
Control Panel. This feature has been known to negatively impact xemu
performance.

## Linux Performance Considerations

### CPU Performance Scaling

You may want to check that your CPU scaling governor is set to `performance`.
In a terminal enter the following command to see current governor state:

```bash
cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor
```

If you see `powersave` printed, you may wish to switch to the `performance`
profile. To select the `performance` profile:

```bash
echo performance | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor
```

## Switchroot/Jetson setup

If you are running Switchroot/L4T Ubuntu on your Nintendo Switch or Jetson device, you have two options:
- Install xemu using the [official PPA](https://launchpad.net/~mborgerson/+archive/ubuntu/xemu). This gives you the option to quickly install and update xemu like any other package on your device. To do so, run the following:
```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:mborgerson/xemu
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install xemu
```
- Install xemu via the [L4T Megascript](https://github.com/cobalt2727/L4T-Megascript/wiki/)'s build script (check the `Initial Setup` page in their wiki to get started).
During their "initial setup" script, you'll be prompted to install SDL2 - choose yes to upgrade to newer SDL2 binaries. Afterwards, you can install xemu itself from the menu. **Skip the "initial setup" script if you're not on a Switch or other Tegra hardware!**
The Megascript's [build script](https://github.com/cobalt2727/L4T-Megascript/blob/master/scripts/games_and_emulators/xemu.sh) gets you the newest updates sooner and has been confirmed to result in a performance boost over the PPA, but it is not packaged by the xemu developers. Use at your own discretion. To update xemu, simply run the Megascript's `Auto Updater` script.

If you see the following error, this is a bug from older releases of Switchroot's L4T Ubuntu:
```bash
dbus[12047]: arguments to dbus_message_new_method_call() were incorrect, assertion "path != NULL" failed in file ../../../dbus/dbus-message.c line 1362.
This is normally a bug in some application using the D-Bus library.

  D-Bus not built with -rdynamic so unable to print a backtrace
```

This can be fixed by [updating to the newest Switchroot L4T Ubuntu release following this guide](https://wiki.switchroot.org/en/Linux/Ubuntu-Install-Guide#updates-for-previous-30-installs).
