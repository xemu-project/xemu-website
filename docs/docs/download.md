### Ubuntu 18.04 and newer

Users running recent versions of Ubuntu (18.04 and newer) are recommended to install through the daily build PPA repository. At the command line, run the following:

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:mborgerson/xemu
sudo apt update
sudo apt install xemu
```

You can now launch xemu through your typical launcher, or by typing `xemu` at the command line.

### Other Linux Distributions

Users running non-Ubuntu distributions are currently recommended to [build from source](building-from-source.md#linux).
