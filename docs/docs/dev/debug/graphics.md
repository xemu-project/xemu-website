!!! tip "Tip: Testing"

    These NV2A [unit tests](https://github.com/abaire/nxdk_pgraph_tests){target=_blank} are a great way to isolate and troubleshoot graphical differences between xemu and real hardware.

    The [snapshot](../../../snapshots/) feature within xemu is another convenient way to quickly test problem areas without having to repeatedly play through large sections of a game.
