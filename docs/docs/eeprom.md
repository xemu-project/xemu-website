The EEPROM is a small chip on the Xbox that contains various settings. xemu
emulates this EEPROM and the contents are stored in a file which you can
select in the xemu Settings dialog.

When you start xemu, if you have not provided an desired EEPROM image file a
valid EEPROM image will be generated for you.
